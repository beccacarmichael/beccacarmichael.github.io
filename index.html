        <p> I am a life long adventurer and nature lover. I have been able
            to combine my passion for nature, the environment and the outdoors
            in my past education, career and travels. I have been able to work 
            along some great people and do some great things and I can not wait
            to continue leading my life to align with my passions.
        </p> 
        <p> I have studied Environmental Geography at Nipissing University, 
            Ecosystem Management at Fleming College and I am now studying Geographic 
            Information Systems at Fleming College. During my education I have been able
            to study along like-minded people and learn from them to not only develop 
            my education but also develop my passions. I have also worked for some environmentally 
            conscious companies - most notably MEC. During my time there I was able to develop connections 
            across the country and teach members of the company a lot of the cool skills I have 
            developed in my personal life and through my education. 
         </p> 
        <p> I enjoy many different types of adventuring from camping, hiking and mountain biking 
            to traveling and exploring new areas. I have been able to travel both near and far and have gotten to 
            experience many new cultures and natural areas. I have traveled form Ontario 
            east and to many places in the US and Europe. After each trip I always come home with many new stories and
            a strengthened connection to the environment.

        <!-- Made a table to mimick buttons at the bottom of the page to link to the other two pages, I found out you could actually just make buttons (much latter) 
            So to make the table look like a button I: centered the table, put link to other page in table columns, make it so that it opens another tab (change into a button) fill the colour so that it looks nice and like a button. 
            The table has 3 coloums the middle one is blank so that there is a space between the fake buttons - I REALLY wish I made buttons - should change this -->
